This project is **a collection of small and focused tutorials** - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem. 
A strong focus of these is, of course, the Quarkus Framework - Eclipse MicroProfile, RESTEasy, Apache Camel.... 
In additional to Quarkus, the modules here are covering a number of aspects in Java.
